	<!-- TITLED BOX appearance - this is intended to be a box with borders of some sort
								 which also has a title drawn into it
								 
								 the titled box can also have an optional overlay
								 appearance which is drawn on top of this one, everywhere
								 except where the title is drawn; you can use this to
								 add adornments to the bordered region without them
								 cluttering up the title and making it unreadable
								 
								 to use the overlay appearance, just add a set of
								 graphics called "appearance_top_left..." etc,
								 and an XML file called "appearance.xml"
