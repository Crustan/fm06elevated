<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="442">4-4-2</a></font><br>
Much-favoured tactical <a href="#formation">formation</a> in which a team lines up with four defenders, four midfield players and two strikers. The two central defenders are flanked by <a href="#full_back">full-backs</a> and two <a href="#winger">wingers</a> play outside the central midfielders.
</p>
 
<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="attributes">Attributes</a></font><br>
The ability of players and coaches in the game are represented by a score out of 20 for each of their skills - 'attributes'. Some or all of a player's attributes may be masked, meaning you'll need to examine a potential signing closely, usually by assigning scouts, to discover their true ability.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="auto_save">Auto Save</a></font><br>
Football Manager can automatically save your progress at intervals to ensure you lose minimal information in the event your computer becomes unstable. You can alter these intervals on the <a href="preferences.htm">Preferences</a> page.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="backroom">Backroom</a></font><br>
The players, manager and chairman of a football club are constantly in the glare of the media, but without the backroom staff, those behind-the-scenes figures such as physios and scouts, no team could achieve success. Assembling the right backroom staff is a key objective of every football manager.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="balance">Balance</a></font><br>
As well as being an attribute in itself, balance is a term often used to assess the quality of a team as a unit. Simply fielding the best eleven players on the planet is no guarantee of success. Aside from obvious considerations, such as their positions, a team's balance depends on how the players complement one another. A perfectly balanced four-player midfield, for instance, could consist of a left-footed left winger, a right-footed right winger, and a complementary duo of one attack-minded and one defensively minded central midfielder.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="bosman_ruling">Bosman Ruling</a></font><br>
A European judgement, named after former professional footballer John Bosman, allows players to move freely between clubs at the end of their existing contract. Famous Bosman transfers include Sol Campbell to Arsenal from Tottenham Hostpur in 2001 and Steve McManaman's transfer from Liverpool to Real Madrid in 1999.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="caps">Caps</a></font><br>
The term 'international cap' refers to players making an appearance for their national side. It originates from the late nineteenth century when headgear in football was common. It is debatable exactly when the first international caps were awarded, but around this time there existed the practice of presenting a player with a cap for each appearance - usually embroided with an emblem of their nation. The practice continues today.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="captain">Captain</a></font><br>
Your enforcer on the pitch. The team captain should be a respected and charismatic individual who will make key decisions in the heat of the action and instruct players. Has a key role in motivating the team and provide leadership. Choose your captain wisely as it could affect the morale and performance levels of your entire squad. See <a href="tactics.htm">Tactics</a>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="corner">Corner-kick</a></font><br>

A full-back plays either on the left- or right-side of defence in a rigid defensive role, usually as part of a 'back four' defensive line (as in <a href="442">4-4-2</a>). Wing-backs have more freedom to make forward runs and are usually positioned slightly further up the field and in a five-man defence.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="goal_kick">Goal-kick</a></font><br>

</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="mind_games">Mind Games</a></font><br>
At the top of every sport, psychology is as much a part of a winning formula as ability on the field, and football is no different. Managers are constantly clashing, seeking a psychological edge in the build-up and aftermath of a key encounter. Football Manager gives you the opportunity to enter a war of words, reply to stinging attacks on your ability or sing the praises of a boss you respect. See <a href="release_comment.htm">Release Comment</a>
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="minnow">Minnow</a></font><br>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="nationality">Nationality</a></font><br>
A player can adopt a nationality or multiple nationalities according to blood lines (eg an English grandmother could qualify a player for British nationality) or residency. Many countries have strict rules about letting players from certain countries ply their trade in their leagues in order to protect opportunities for homegrown players.

</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="odds">Odds</a></font><br>
The price offered by bookmakers based on the probability of a given outcome in an event. E.g. odds of 10/1 will give a gambler a £10 payout for every £1 bet placed, indicating the likelihood of this event is not high. Odds of 4/5 suggest an event is likely as only £4 will be paid out for every £5 placed.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="offside">Offside</a></font><br>
A contentious rule stating that no attacker should be in front of the ball and between the second last opposing player and the goal line in the opposing team's half, at the moment a ball is played forward to him. If the attacker interferes with play, with an opponent or gains an advantage by being in that position then they are deemed to be offside and a free kick is awarded to the defending team. See <a href="#offside_trap">Offside Trap</a>.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="offside_trap">Offside Trap</a></font><br>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="poach">Poach</a></font><br>
In playing terms, poaching is the act of stealing unspectacular goals, usually from short range, although the term is more often used in football parlance to refer to brazenly, underhandedly, or illegally acquiring the services of a player or member of staff from under the noses of a rival or their existing employer.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="red_yellow_card">Red Card/Yellow Card</a></font><br>
A referee can award a red card for serious foul play. A red card results automatically when a player receives two yellow cards. A yellow card is seen as a warning as well as a reprimand - it doesn't result in a player having to leave the field of play without being replaced, but it can carry with it disciplinary points that can result in a playing ban if they accrue sufficiently.

</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="squad">Squad</a></font><br>
The roster of players at your disposal is split into the teams you have at your club, usually the first-team, reserve and youth teams.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="target_man">Target Man</a></font><br>
Many tactics make use of a target man, a player who operates <a href="#up_front">up front</a> and is the target of long balls and direct passes. Target men are often deployed in defensive formations as an outlet for teams under pressure. If you decide to operate with a target man you should ensure he will be capable of holding the ball up and keeping it under close control while he awaits support from on-rushing midfield players. 
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="throw_in">Throw In</a></font><br>
When the ball goes out of play on either side of the pitch a throw-in is awarded to the team who didn't get the last touch. A player cannot be <a href="#offside">off side</a> if he receives the ball from a throw-in.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="transfer_bid">Transfer Bid</a></font><br>
In Football Manager, much as in real football, players' contracts are owned by one or more clubs. In order to sign a player clubs must first approach a club and agree a fee to release the player from his commitment to his current contract. The only exceptions are when a player is nearing the end of his contract, as he can negotiate a deal to commence after his current contract ends, or when the player is not under contract to any club.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="transfer_list">Transfer List</a></font><br>
When a player is no longer wanted by a club they are placed on the transfer list (See <a href="set_transfer_status.htm">Set Transfer Status</a>). Signing a player who is not transfer listed is often more difficult as the buying manager will have to work to prise the player from his club, sometimes by offering a transfer fee that greatly exceeds the value of the individual.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="transfer_window">Transfer Window</a></font><br>
In many footballing nations a rule has been adopted to prevent the free flow of players between clubs. The Transfer Window limits the time when clubs may buy a player who is in contract. When the transfer window is closed movement in the transfer market is limited to players who are out of contract or who move on a temporary <a href="#loan">loan</a> basis.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="up_front">Up Front</a></font><br>
Players playing in an attacking role are deemed to be up front. Your strikers usually play up front.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="util_player">Utility Player</a></font><br>
A player who is adept at performing in a variety of positions, although one who is often not world class in any single area of the pitch. Examine a player's <a href="player.htm">positions</a> to see how well they can perform in different roles in Football Manager.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="winger">Winger</a></font><br>
A midfield or sometimes forward player who is asked to play in a wide position. Such players often run the touch-line and are expected to put in crosses for the forward players.
</p>

<p>
<font color="heading"><a name="work_permit">Work Permit</a></font><br>
Based on a player's <a href="#nationality">nationality</a>, certain countries make demands that a player has participated in a certain percentage of games played by their national team, before they grant a work permit to play in their chosen nation. In Football Manager you will be notified through <a href="search_scouting.htm">scouting</a> reports if a player will need a work permit and an application will automatically be made for one in the event you do agree terms for a player who requires one. In the event the permit is turned down, you should always contest the decision as, in some cases, the ruling will be overturned.
