<!-- an example panel -->
<panel>
	<!-- the panel has very simple content, just a label and a button arrange vertically
	     one below the other -->
	     
	<!-- you specify the layout of the items with layout attachments -->
	<!-- this is the trickiest bit of the whole process -->
	
	<!-- first, we tell this container to lay out its content from left to right -->
	<layout class="arrange_horizontal_attachment" alignment="left"/>
	
	<!-- then we tell it to make sure that all of its content sticks to the -->
	<!-- top and bottom of the panel -->
	<layout class="centre_in_parent_attachment" alignment="vertical" layout_children="true" priority="1"/>
	
	<!-- we want the panel to be as wide as all of it's content added together -->
    <layout class="fit_children_attachment" alignment="horizontal,fill"/>
    
    <!-- we want the panel to be as high as it's highest content -->
	<layout class="fit_children_attachment" alignment="vertical" offset="0"/>
	
	
	<!-- this is where we actually create the widgets which form the content of the panel -->
	
	<!-- first, a button -->
	<!-- we will leave its text blank, because we're going to set it from code -->
	<widget class="text_button" id="bcil" auto_size="horizontal" spec="text,small" colour="white" style="none"/>
	
	<!-- then a popup -->
	<widget class="breadcrumbs_popup" id="bcri"/>
	
	<!-- then a divider -->
	<widget class="picture" id="bcse" auto_size="all" file="breadcrumbs/seperator"/>
